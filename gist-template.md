# WGT Regex Tutorial

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)
As a new web developer I am always interested in learning new tools that can assist in the coding process.  Regular Expressions, or regex, are one such tool.

## Summary

In this tutorial I will be explaining the following regex which matches an email address.  This is very useful for validating that a user has entered a valid email address while using your application.  
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
